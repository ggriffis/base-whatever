This app will take input of a base for a numbering system and the number as represented in the numbering system and then convert it to its equivalent in the regular base 10 numbering system we are accustomed to.  For example, base 2 with a number of 11 would convert to 3 in the base 10 numbering system.  Here is a website with more information about these concepts.  A future version of this app will allow you to convert the other way, from base 10 to another base.
